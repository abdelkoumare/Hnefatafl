<h1>Brandubh Rules</h1>

<h2>Win Conditions (Corner Escape)</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Attackers win by capturing the King.</li>
    <li>Defenders win by moving the King onto any of the corner squares on the board.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Movement</h2>

<ul>
    <li>All pieces move like rooks in chess - they can move any number of squares along either the
        row or column they are in.</li>
    <li>A piece cannot move through another piece.</li>
    <li>Only the king can be on the central throne square, however other pieces can move through it.</li>
    <li>Only the king can move onto the corner squares. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Capturing Pieces</h2>

<ul>
    <li>All pieces except for the King are captured if they are pinched between two opposing pieces
        - horizontally or vertically.</li>
    <li>A piece can also be captured if it is pinched between an opposing piece and an empty throne
        square.</li>
    <li>A piece can also be captured if it is pinched between an opposing piece and one of the corner
        squares.</li>
    <li>The capture only counts if a move of the opponent created the pinch. Thus, it is safe for a
        piece to move between two opposing pieces on it's turn.</li>
    <li>It is possible to capture multiple pieces in the same turn.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Capturing the King</h2>

<ul>
    <li>If the King is on the central square, he must be surrounded on all four
        sides by attackers in order to be captured.</li>

    <li>If the King is adjacent to the central square, the King is captured if he is surrounded on
        three sides by attackers, and on the fourth side by the center square.</li>

    <li>If the King is not on the central square or adjacent to the central square, then he is
        captured like a regular piece.</li>

    <li>Note that the King can be captured if he is between an opposing piece and a corner square.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Conditions</h2>

<ul>
    <li>If a player cannot move, then he loses the game.</li>
</ul>
